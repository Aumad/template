			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology is used in many aspects of the discipline. It is used in the research process, transporting, and communicating processes. For researching the use of computers and data bases are very useful. During transportation it is technology such as trains and trucks that carry the product. In addition, technology is used to track products whether it be via satellite tracking or scanning of bar codes listing a products last location for periodical schedule updates. This is very useful when communicating between businesses as to where a product is and when it will arrive. Phones, computers, bar code systems, and satellite tracking are all methods used to communicate with businesses. Technology is a vital part of any good supply chain system, it is important to hold power over technology rather than relying on suppliersâ€™ technology. In this way it would be easier to switch to a new supplier. That is why it is important to stay up to date with the latest technological innovations in the field. A good way to stay up to date would be reading the latest research publications and trade magazines as well as your own independent research.</p>
