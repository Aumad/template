			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>As a result I believe a revival will occur of the family culture of America. Families will once again spend more time together and less time staring at a screen filled with adultery and deviance. The end result will be the upbringing of a new generation that remembers the important fundamentals of the past that created the country we live in now. One that promoted education, hard work, religion, and marriage; rather than the ideas promoted in shows like the Jersey Show, the ideas of promiscuity, alcoholism, and solving problems not with words; but with violence and back stabbing behaviors.  Once children look up to their parents rather than a group of individuals who engage in drinking and partying all the time; such as the cast of Jersey Shore. As the bond of family becomes a main focus once again to the lives of our American youth these idols will be the ones to fade into the past. As the importance of family is reinforced children will be more inclined to avoid the modern culture we have come to know, and to adapt to the culture being taught by their parents and other community members.</p>
