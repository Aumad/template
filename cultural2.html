			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this proposal is to make fellow Americans aware of our constantly deteriorating culture. This country was once famous for the American dream. A dream that comprised of making a new life in a new country. For immigrants, America was a beam of hope and freedom. Once known for the amazing opportunities and welcoming culture has all but faded. Now this country fades in infamy, the land once known for its equal opportunity is now known simply for its lack of culture. The “new” American culture we have come to know today is comprised of alcohol and pleasurable company. To other countries Americans’ reputation of being hard-working has now been warped into an opinion of Americans being fat and lazy. In most countries women have an obligation of modesty, however in our modern day culture we promote the promiscuousness of women for self-pleasure. The traditional values the country was built on are now deteriorating and are changing into a selfish, adulterous new culture.</p>
			<p>The blame is not to be put upon anyone except ourselves. In our everyday lives we perpetuate these stereotypes about ourselves. By allowing our media to broadcast programs with explicit themes and images we are giving our consent to have our long standing traditions and culture to be replaced with a new culture that promotes drinking and discourages values we once held so sacred; such as the institution of marriage, or the emphasis of religion. The standards we hold for the media have all but disappeared, things once kept in the privacy of one’s bedroom has become a regular scene on most programs. A modern day artifact of popular culture that is a prime example of the deterioration of American culture is a TV show known as Jersey Shore.</p>
