			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>I interviewed my Macroecon professor Obst on the key role supply chain managers play in our economic system and to elaborate on different types of supply chain management systems. Professor Obst explained how communication between businesses can be very difficult especially when most businesses are in competition with each other. A supply chain manager is used to keep a business on track with their quotas and deadlines. When I asked exactly how a supply chain manager is used for this purpose he replied that supply chain managers must know exactly what a company needs, how much of it they need, and when they need it by. From there, they must strategize a plan on how to make all this possible. He continued by comparing supply chain managers to a train conductor. They always know how much cargo they are carrying, where it’s going, and when they need to be there. For this they must maintain effective communication between the different organizations his own company deals with. If a supplier doesn’t have your order ready it’s your job to make up for that in the schedule and let the next person down the chain know that you won’t be ready either.</p>
			<p>Communication is key in all aspects of life. This is especially true for a supply chain manager. When transporting products or materials you need to be in contact with supplier and consumer, the consumer will usually be another business. The reason for the intense amount of communication is for both parties to know exactly how much of what is being transported and when and where it will depart/arrive. Production is usually a time sensitive matter, quotas must be met and consumers must be kept happy. If any unexpected events occur it is important to remain in constant communication to resolve any potential problems that may occur.</p>
