			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Dr. Robert Handfield, a professor at North Carolina State University wrote an article titled What is Supply Chain Management? The article summarizes what supply chain management is and the core ideas behind it. According to Dr. Handfield there are two core ideas behind supply chain management. The first is that practically every product that reaches an end user represents the cumulative effort of multiple organizations. These organizations are referred to collectively as the supply chain (Handfield, 2011). What is meant by the first idea is that no product is created by any one organization. With any final product, it must first be made by raw materials. These raw materials are either grown/harvested by another organization and the supplies are sent down the chain to the next organization onto the next until it reaches its end use. This is what is known as the supply chain. The second idea Dr. Handfield suggests is that although supply chains have existed for a long time, most organizations only focus on what happens within their own “four walls.” Few businesses understood, much less managed, the entire chain of activities that ultimately delivered products to their final customers. The result was disjointed and often ineffective supply chains (Handfield, 2011). What this second idea is meant to portray is that although there is a long standing series of chains that bring final products to a customer, most businesses are ignorant of it. They often only concern themselves with their own series in the chain, this is why supply chain managers exist. To coordinate the chain as efficiently and effectively as possible. Dr. Handfield also elaborates on this idea by defining what supply chain management is. Supply chain management, then, is the active management of supply chain activities to maximize customer value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. It represents a conscious effort by the supply chain firms to develop and run supply chains in the most effective & efficient ways possible. Supply chain activities cover everything from product development, sourcing, production, and logistics, as well as the information systems needed to coordinate these activities (Handfield, 2011). This is a broader definition, it states all the different types of activities supply chain covers. The mention of informations systems is a large part of supply chain that is often overlooked. Supply chain management is not only used in sending physical products in efficient ways, but as well as sharing information. Dr. Handfield reveals then elaborates on how physical products and information travel down the chain; the organizations that make up a supply chain are “linked” together through physical flows and information flows. Physical flows involve transformation, movement, and storage of goods and materials. They are the most visible piece of the supply chain. But just as important are information flows. Information flows allow the various supply chain partners to coordinate their long-term plans, and to control the day-to-day flow of goods and material up and down the supply chain (Handfield, 2011). By incorporating the information flows Dr. Handfield is able to show how broad supply chain management really is. The supply chain affects multiple businesses on a day-today basis as well as a year-to-year basis. Without the correct management many businesses wouldn’t be able to run as effectively. As he mentioned above, a poorly managed chain can result in disjointed and ineffective chains.</p>
			<p>Supply Chain Management plays a huge part in every type of producer/consumer business. In order to produce a product a producer would first need materials. In our free market economy it is rare that one company would produce a product completely independent of other companies for example; a paper company such as International Paper that is ran in the United States would first need raw materials from a lumber company like The Hudson River Mill. Once the River Mill has acquired the materials it is prepared to sell to International Paper, it must figure out a way to send the materials. A supply chain manager would be hired to plan a route and method of transportation for the supplies. A common method for sending supplies like logs would be to hire a trucking company to drive the supplies from the mill to International Paper the supply chain manager would be responsible for hiring the trucking company and planning the most effective route. Without the logs there would be no paper, without the supply chain manager the logs would never reach the paper company and there would be nothing to sell.</p>
