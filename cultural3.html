			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The Jersey Shore is an American reality television series which ran on MTV from December 3, 2009 to December 20, 2012. The series follows the lives of eight “typical Italian” housemates, who also refer to themselves as “Guidos.” The show films as they spend their summer at the Jersey Shore, in later seasons the venue changes to Miami Beach, Florida and later to Italy. This artifact depicts the “new” American dream, with themes of drinking, fighting, and sex. Most people now days would consider getting drunk and going to a club to find a partner to return home with them normal. However 20 years ago these acts would be frowned upon. However, every episode of Jersey Shore would repeat these events. As the men from the show would approach women while their judgment was impaired from alcohol and coerce them into bed; audiences would idolize these actions. The normal way of solving conflicts on the show was not to use words however, but fists instead. Long standing household values such as waiting until marriage before engaging in sexual behaviors are torn down by the new ideas proposed in this television program. Although these themes are ever-present the show’s popularity continued to sky rocket. In my own high school the “Guido” culture became the norm as more and more people tuned in to the latest episode of the Jersey Shore the mantra of “GTL” or gym; tan; laundry, the basic ritual the cast would perform before a night of heavy drinking, became second nature to my fellow classmates.</p>
