			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Research is key to any successful business model. As listed in the paragraph above the supply chain manager must plan the most time and cost efficient method of transportation for a product. A supply chain manager for International Paper must research many elements before finalizing his plans. Some of those elements would be travel time; the Hudson River Mill is located in Corinth, New York, the International Paper company is in Memphis, Tennessee. First, the manager must research the different types of transportations available for the materials. Secondly, after choosing the transportation method successful supply chain manager would research the average travel time from these two locations and set expectations for clients accordingly. Afterwards, the manager must choose a corresponding business that would be able to transport the materials, example; if choosing two send logs through trucks you must decide which company to choose from. You must research the different companies along with their pricing, reputation, and reliability. You are held accountable for all mistakes made during the transporting process. This makes research incredibly important for this discipline. A better understanding of your segment of supply chain can lead to a much more efficient system. By researching the different suppliers and methods available you can cut costs and increase revenue. For example, International Paper could have bought logs from a different lumber company; however they found the most cost effective and reliable company which would be the Hudson River Mill.</p>
			<p>Along with communicating with companies within a supply chain, in order for the field to expand it is also important to communicate with other supply chain manager. This is often done through articles and publications. Such as the trade magazine known as Inside Supply Management. An article in this magazine that provides insight on successful supply chain managing titled Commercial Acumen Leads to Buyer Power states that in order to become successful in supply chain management you must understand the nuances of your industry segment so thoroughly that you can react well to any situation that occurs. This requires a strong sense of commercial acumen, an important skill for supply chain management practitioners (Goss, 2014). In summation, in any business unintended situations will arise, it is important to know your supply chain as well as possible in order to find a solution, or to have a sense of commercial acumen. The article gives a look at what commercial acumen is; commercial acumen is the ability to assess business situations and information, then make rational decisions and take sensible actions that puts your company in a more optimal position (Goss, 2014). This idea of a commercial acumen is developed through research and experience. It is important to study other systems of supply chain to develop your own effective strategy. An initial step in developing your commercial acumen is understanding the market segments in which your company purchases items and services, you can do this by reading professional journals and trade magazines specific to the categories you manage (Goss, 2014). The supply chain management field has been around for a long time, in order to become the best in this discipline you must learn from those who have been around longer than you. That is why it is important to research as many different strategies that have been implemented in different supply chain segments. The best way to do this would be to read relevant scholarly magazines and keeping up to date with the latest findings, this too will help build commercial acumen. Once you understand the market, you can further refine your commercial acumen by focusing on what you can do to help your company develop buyer power (Goss, 2014). Once you understand your field you and your company will be in a better position as buyers. Buyer power is a key in this discipline, being able to receive more volume for the same price would be an example of buyer power. Knowledge is, of course, the cornerstone of buyer power, and knowledge leads to expertise. Read as much as possible (Goss, 2014). The more one researches, the greater understanding they have of the business system. This information could be critical when problem situations occur, time is money, the more knowledge one possess, the faster they will be able to make decisions and the more efficient their system will become.</p>
			<p>I conducted an interview with a former supply chain management student who graduated from Michigan State University. Mona Simpson, who now works as a supply chain manager at Apple about the importance of the way literacies are used to create and communicate knowledge in our field. Mona gave me some insight on how it is very important to stay on pace with the latest research advancements and how knowledge itself can make the difference between a successful supply chain and a failure. She elaborated on how many companies and competitors too have their own supply chain managers. The reason being, companies are all in constant competition. The most efficient system will always prevail, it is imperative for that system to be your own. If a suppliers average delivery time for a shipment to a company such as Apple was three days, and another supplier approached apple with a shipment time of two days. Apple would go with the second company with the faster shipping time. If that first supplier managed to also bring its shipment time down to two days as well, then Apple would have no reason to change suppliers. That is why it is important to constantly be learning, as technology changes and our society moves at a faster pace we too must change our systems and adapt to maintain as much efficiency as possible. Mona went on to explain that she herself is subscribed to many different newsletters and trade magazines to stay up to date with the latest findings. She explained how she also travels to supply chain conferences to learn as much as she can so she may also move up her job chain and hopefully manage her own system.</p>
