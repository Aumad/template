		<h1>Looking back, while moving forward</h1>
		<p>There is a certain degree of writing ability that is expected from students when obtaining higher learning. As much as one believes that their own ability is equivalent or more to a student only one grade higher than them, the disparity between their levels is very steep. When I first began this course my writing ability was mediocre at best. I couldn’t understand why I, as a business student, would need a writing class. I believed I had nothing to gain from this course and that my novice writing skills were good enough to carry me to my end goals. However, I was extremely mistaken. With each new assignment I was introduced to a variety of writing criteria’s and techniques. Each of the four assignments had specific skills it focused on to build. I am going to revisit and revise each of the assignments in order to help incoming students understand the big picture of first year writing and how it enhances their chances of success in their programs.</p>
		<p>The first assignment in this course was the Lived Experiences project. The purpose of this paper was to identify an academic or professional career track you were interested in and identify and describe a piece of technology that you had a personal experience with and how that experience has led you to that chosen field or major. My major is supply chain management, it involves the control of goods and how they get from one place to another. The piece of technology I used was the smartphone. My own personal experience with that piece of technology was using my smartphone to order a phone case off amazon. This is related to my major because once first using amazon I gained an interest upon how exactly it was my phone case got to me from a different country which eventually led to my interest in supply chain management. This assignment was used in teaching me how to expand upon my ideas and order them in a structural way. Another purpose was to teach students how to give good descriptions, by using a personal experience students must be incredibly descriptive in order to paint an effective picture of their experience. The first assignment alone showed me the importance of writing as a skill and how it can be used to effectively organize and portray your ideas. The use of a personal experience can be critical while writing in the future, it provides a strong sense of passion to what you are writing about. As well as giving a sense of personal investment which makes one more inclined to listening to your opinion as well.</p>
		<p>The second assignment was a Cultural Analysis Proposal. The assignment was to select an artifact of popular culture and explain how that artifact illustrates or depicts either a group of people or a social issue. Afterwards, I provided a thoughtful analysis of what my artifact contributes to the discussion of that issue and to propose a solution that helps or possibly solves the social issue. Formal proposals are a significant type of document in the technical workplace so this assignment is was used to teach how to make one. The artifact of a popular culture I chose was a show called Jersey Shore. This show is tied to the social issue of our ever-deteriorating culture. The Jersey Shore encourages deviant behaviors such as drinking, pre-marital sex, and fighting. The adulterated material broad casted on this show sends a bad message to the youth of our country, encouraging behaviors against our traditional values. Proposed solutions to revive our old American culture were to; have parents more involved in children’s education so the parents’ values may have more of an influence on a child’s future actions. Another solution was to encourage the family dinner. When families spend more time together they form a bond of respect between parent and child which will lead to the passing on of values discouraging deviant behaviors. This assignment in particular was very effective in developing my proposal skills. Proposals are used in many different fields and industries. It is how one convinces another to listen to what they have to say. It taught me organizational and formatting skills. In particular it taught me how to write an executive summary. A style used in many different fields as a summation of a report, also the convections of MLA format. Prior to this assignment I had never known of executive summaries and their purposes in the professional world.</p>
		<p>The third assignment was a Formal Research Project. It gave the opportunity to identify themes and terms for analysis so I could begin understanding and practicing the expectations for higher learning. It also allowed me to engage in effective invention, arrangement, style, and revision practices. I had no idea what it meant to be an active member in an academic discipline. The ultimate purpose was to give my audience an understanding of the ways that literacy are used to create and communicate knowledge in my discipline. This assignment was used to show how different academic principles have different ways of presenting knowledge in written forms. This report was used to build an understanding of how writing, reading, and researching operate in that discipline. Part of the requirements of this project were to analyze one scholarly article, a trade publication, and an interview with a practicing member of that field. The field I researched was supply chain management, the researching portion alone showed me how much literacy ability can affect your career path. For example, many supply chain managers publish their findings in trade magazines and scholarly articles. After reading many of them the caliber of writing was clearly much higher than my own which. The assignments length was between 2,700- 3,000 words which is the longest paper I’ve written to date. I gained the ability to stretch and expand information as well as presenting it in a structural and entertaining way. As well as truly teaching me what it means to be a supply chain manager, I assumed that the field was very individualistic, but in reality there is a large community of supply chain managers that communicate with each other frequently posting new findings and techniques that could be used to better oneself in that field.</p>
		<p>The fourth assignment was the Multimedia Remix Project. This project came with two portions; the first was to revise and transmediate one of my earlier projects, strengthening the original purpose, while transforming it into a short documentary. The project I chose to use was the cultural analysis project of one of my group members which was about the social issue of music videos and their explicit and degrading themes towards women. We took this issue and turned it into a video, which features interviews of a variety of students and adults. The purpose is to be able to convert one form of literature to another while making the purpose and issue stronger while also making it more entertaining. When starting the course I had no idea how to create a video let alone convert on idea from paper to a video one could watch. These abilities will be used time and time again throughout ones college education and perhaps even further unto ones career path. Another important lesson to be learned from this assignment is the ability to collaborate with others and merging a variety of different writing styles into one unison project. The second portion of the project was to create an individual memo. The memo is used to critically reflect on our rhetorical practices and to evaluate the project I have created. It also develops an understanding between purpose, audience, and communication strategies. It also lets you reflect on each aspect of the writing process from choosing the issue to the audience and the means we used to convey our information.</p>
		<p>As prepared as one believes they are for higher education, a higher degree of writing must too be learned. Each of the four assignments gave valuable skills and lessons in order to improve one’s writing capabilities. The first assignment focused on effectively communicating a personal story while also relating it to an academic topic. The second assignment was used to build on ones analytical skills as well as structuring a formal proposal. The third assignment taught me what it means to be an active member of an academic discipline. The researching aspect of the third assignment showed me a variety of uses for writing in my field as well as making a formal investigation using sources such as interviewing people to reading trade magazines. The fourth and final assignment showed the importance of targeting an audience, and once that audience is selected conveying information in a professional and entertaining form. As well as, converting an essay to a video and merging different writing styles from different people into one well put together project. The big picture of first year writing classes is clear, it improves the skills you arrive with as well as giving you a variety of different styles and skills. First-year writing classes are detrimental to one’s success in a particular field.</p>
