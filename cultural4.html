			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>With shows such as Jersey Shore being broadcasted with such graphic themes and images our youth is being taught that actions such as the ones depicted in the show are socially acceptable. This issue is a serious one, when children see a man disrespecting and pushing a woman on television, then later see the man be praised around the country it could have some serious consequences. When exposed to so much adulterated material at a young age a permanent impression is left in that child’s mind. If our youth grow up constantly being exposed to such things all remnants of a modest American culture will fade into the past.</p>
			<p>I believe that it is not right to allow such programs to be allowed on the air without proper censoring. Television broadcasters have become too lax with their standards of what is appropriate and what is not. When any child with a T.V. can witness the females of Jersey Shore becoming intimate with one another. It is truly appalling to know that American teenagers strive to imitate their favorite member of the cast. I have even fallen victim to the new “Guido” culture myself. From imitating the hair style and dress of my favorite character to engaging in the very same deviant behaviors of drinking and coercing woman. A young mind is a very impressionable thing that can easily be manipulated to believe that what was once wrong is now right and vice versa.</p>
