    <p>The lived experiences paper was quite a difficult task for me. My major doesn't really involve too much technology. The smartphone was the best thing I could think of at the time. I think I did really well on the paper though. I receivd a lot of good comments from the peer reviews. This was a strange prompt but I think I managed to do a very good job so far. my paper is still in its rough draft so it's still not perfect. </p>
