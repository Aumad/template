                <h1>In class activity 1</h1>
                <p> The purpose of this video was suicide awareness and to tell the story of Uncle Ronnie and how it affected Randy's life and the loved one's around him. The video achieves its purpose by showing how much suicide affects the people close to suicide victims The letter shown in the beginning of the video was written 5 years prior to the video showing how a tragedy like suicide could affect someone for life. The video was structured in a unique way. It played a letter written to his Uncle Ronnie in the start but changed to Randy giving an emotional narrative of how both his uncle and him are similar and how Ronnie could've chose a different path rather than suicide Randy begins to cry in the video demonstrating how truly affected he was by the death of his uncle. This video can help me try to revise my lived experience project by trying to reach my audience on a more emotional level and by trying to relate myself to them. Randy also uses a variety of descriptive words to make his video less bland which I will follow in my own paper.</p>
