                <p> The purpose of this video was suicide awareness and to tell the story of Uncle Ronnie and how it affected Randy's life and the loved one's around him. The video achieves its purpose by showing how much suicide affects the people close to suicide victims The letter shown in the beginning of the video was written 5 years prior to the video showing how a tragedy like suicide could affect someone for life. The video was structured in a unique way. It played a letter written to his Uncle Ronnie in the start but changed to Randy giving an emotional narrative of how both his uncle and him are similar and how Ronnie could have chose a different path rather than suicide Randy begins to cry in the video demonstrating how truly affected he was by the death of his uncle. This video can help me try to revise my lived experience project by trying to reach my audience on a more emotional level and by trying to relate myself to them. Randy also uses a variety of descriptive words to make his video less bland which I will follow in my own paper.</p>
                
                <h1>My thoughts on the lived experiences project</h1>
                <p>The lived experiences paper was quite a difficult task for me. My major doesn't really involve too much technology. The smartphone was the best thing I could think of at the time. I think I did really well on the paper though. I receivd a lot of good comments from the peer reviews. This was a strange prompt but I think I managed to do a very good job so far. my paper is still in its rough draft so it's still not perfect.</p>

                <p>The group targeted in this video was primarily children and gamers. The social issue at hand is how children spend way too much time away from reality and too much time focused on video games. Children can get so consumed into the fake reality created as a means of entertainment has now become an escape from real life. This is an extremely important issue because if kids are inside playing games all day they will lose the ability to communicate effectively with people without a screen in front of their face. The creators of the video also realized that excessive use of video games can be a bad thing. In the start of the episode the children are all skinny and healthy, minus Cartman, but after spending hours on the computer they slowly deteriorate into obese, acne ridden slobs with no regard for personal hygiene or appearance.  I believe this was an excellent way to address the issue and although it was a bit exaggerated, pointed out some of the negative consequences of excessive gaming.</p>
                <h1>In class activity 3</h1>
                <p>The Chrysler Eminem Super bowl commercial was very effective. It began by showing imagery of Detroit to build a sense of pride in the city as the voiceover began to tell of the hardships the city has seen. The voiceover says “what does this city know about luxury?” to infer that Detroit has never had it easy however, the people of the city still overcome obstacles and persevere. Eminem is one of Detroit’s finest accomplishments and by playing “Lose Yourself” the theme song behind Eminem’s hit movie 8 mile, the story of him growing up in Detroit. It also works to build a sense of pride and recognition in what the city has accomplished. As all this is occurring the Chrysler 200 is appearing slowly out of the darkness and the tagline “imported from Detroit” was used to show that this car was built in Detroit and it was made for the city of hardships. The purpose of building a sense of pride in the city and using that pride to promote a car was very effective.</p>
