                <h1>In class activity 1</h1>
                <p> The purpose of this video was suicide awareness and to tell the story of Uncle Ronnie and how it affected Randy's life and the loved one's around him. The video achieves its purpose by showing how much suicide affects the people close to suicide victims The letter shown in the beginning of the video was written 5 years prior to the video showing how a tragedy like suicide could affect someone for life. The video was structured in a unique way. It played a letter written to his Uncle Ronnie in the start but changed to Randy giving an emotional narrative of how both his uncle and him are similar and how Ronnie could have chose a different path rather than suicide Randy begins to cry in the video demonstrating how truly affected he was by the death of his uncle. This video can help me try to revise my lived experience project by trying to reach my audience on a more emotional level and by trying to relate myself to them. Randy also uses a variety of descriptive words to make his video less bland which I will follow in my own paper.</p>
                
                <h1>My thoughts on the lived experiences project</h1>
                <p>The lived experiences paper was quite a difficult task for me. My major doesn't really involve too much technology. The smartphone was the best thing I could think of at the time. I think I did really well on the paper though. I receivd a lot of good comments from the peer reviews. This was a strange prompt but I think I managed to do a very good job so far. my paper is still in its rough draft so it's still not perfect.</p>
                
                <h1>In class activity 2</h1>
                <p>The group targeted in this video was primarily children and gamers. The social issue at hand is how children spend way too much time away from reality and too much time focused on video games. Children can get so consumed into the fake reality created as a means of entertainment has now become an escape from real life. This is an extremely important issue because if kids are inside playing games all day they will lose the ability to communicate effectively with people without a screen in front of their face. The creators of the video also realized that excessive use of video games can be a bad thing. In the start of the episode the children are all skinny and healthy, minus Cartman, but after spending hours on the computer they slowly deteriorate into obese, acne ridden slobs with no regard for personal hygiene or appearance.  I believe this was an excellent way to address the issue and although it was a bit exaggerated, pointed out some of the negative consequences of excessive gaming.</p>
                <h1>In class activity 3</h1>
                <p>The Chrysler Eminem Super bowl commercial was very effective. It began by showing imagery of Detroit to build a sense of pride in the city as the voiceover began to tell of the hardships the city has seen. The voiceover says “what does this city know about luxury?” to infer that Detroit has never had it easy however, the people of the city still overcome obstacles and persevere. Eminem is one of Detroit’s finest accomplishments and by playing “Lose Yourself” the theme song behind Eminem’s hit movie 8 mile, the story of him growing up in Detroit. It also works to build a sense of pride and recognition in what the city has accomplished. As all this is occurring the Chrysler 200 is appearing slowly out of the darkness and the tagline “imported from Detroit” was used to show that this car was built in Detroit and it was made for the city of hardships. The purpose of building a sense of pride in the city and using that pride to promote a car was very effective.</p>
                  <h1>Video Remix Project</h1>
                <p>The video project may be the most difficult one to date. I have no idea how to edit videos or to combine them. I must rely on my group for this part of the project. I recorded two interviews of my floormates for this project. They and I, both enjoyed being recorded while having intelligent conversation. Camera's are difficult to operate, other than my phone I haven't used any type of camera in years. I had to put a lot of thought of how to record this interview, like what angles and whom to use. I think it ended up very well</p>
                <h1>The Ever-Changing Weather</h1>
                <p>The weather has been getting so nice outside. Campus looks absolutely beautiful now. It is getting harder and harder to focus in class. My work load is piling up more and more and my  willingness to work is getting less and less. I walked along the Red Cedar and it was absolutely beautiful. I have been doing a lot more things outside since the weather has improved. After a full year here at Michigan State University I finally made my way to the Broad art museum. It was mediocre at best, but still enjoyable</p>
                <h1>Group Projects</h1>
                <p>I'm not sure how I feel about group projects, sometimes they are beneficial and other times they can be very detrimental. It all depends on who is in your group. My group for this project is not bad. I feel like we are all very independent people who have come together for a common cause. That is what i believe the best types of groups are made of. We have had a very hard time actually getting together however. Everyone has school, friends, or work. It is very difficult to make time for unexpected meeting timings.</p>
                <h1>End of the Year</h1>
                <p>This year is rapidly coming to its conclusion. It feels as though I have only been in this class for a few weeks, yet it has almost been a full semester. At the start of this semester my writing capabilities were a bit less than average. However, with each new paper issued in this class a new learning oppurtunity was as well. Each prompt had specific skills you would gain through the writing process. An example of this would be the use of scholarly articles in our research projects. Before that actual assignment I left recourses such as that untapped. Now I have gained many new skills.</p>
                <h1>Course retrospect draft</h1>
                <p>I finally wrote my rough draft for the course retrospective paper. That took hours, I'm so glad its finally over. I'm actually not a fan of essays whatsoever. They are very difficult and annoying. It takes me a very long time to finally get my creative juices flowing. I also finished my memo finally but I'll talk about that in my next blog since I have to make so many of them.</p>
                <h1>4/14/2014</h1>
                <p>I spent pretty much the entire day just on work for this class so I'm pretty exhausted today. I guess that’s what happens when you procrastinate for days and do everything at once. I think the worst part of it though is having to make all these blog posts they’re kind of irrelevant. They don't need any specific topic but I know I need 15 of them and I'm pretty close to being done.</p>
                <h1>Memo</h1>
                <p>So I just got done writing my memo. I got to say I don’t really understand the purpose of it. It seems like all I did was talk about what I made my documentary on and why. At least that assignment was short. Most of these assignments are incredibly long and I run out of ideas long before I hit the word limit.</p>
                <h1>Blogging</h1>
                <p>I wonder why people blog in the first place. Is it used like a diary? Should I write about my day? Well I woke up around 12 and went to WRA there I didn’t really do anything but write blogs. After I came back from class I hung out with my friends Mitch and Marco then I began my homework.</p>
                <h1>Blogging Round 2</h1>
                <p>I'm working on these blogs right now and I'm starting to get pretty hungry. Sparty's is right around the corner from me so after I finish this post I'm getting food. I'm sitting in the study lounge of my dorm and my back kind of hurts. The chair I'm sitting on has like zero back support and I've been sitting here for quite some time. People occasionally walk past me and I hope they don't look at my screen cause I feel like I'm writing a dear diary post right now.</p>
                <h1>Blogging Round 3</h1>
                <p>Well I ate and now I'm pretty satisfied. I had some cheese sticks and Doritos. Now I'm back to the blog grind. My friend Marco just showed me his blog and it looks so much cooler than my website. It is cool to say that I did make my own website. I never thought I'd do something like that. I'm also watching South Park and it is hilarious.</p>
                <h1>FINAL BLOG POST</h1>
                <p>Well this is it. The moment I've been waiting for, for the past few hours. My 15th and final blog post. After this I will no longer be posting and I couldn't be happier. I have learned a lot about writing and I didn't think I would do that well in this class but I've actually done really well I expect to get a really good grade. Unless I get points off because my blog posts are kind of pointless.</p>
