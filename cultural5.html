			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>I propose that we revive the old American culture of the past. A huge contributor to the promotion of deviant behaviors is the lack of a family bond. The family has become less and less of an influence over the actions of the countries youth. To reunite families I propose that schools have families become more of an active participant in the learning of a child. That way parents could pass along their values more effectively and discourage any deviant behaviors. If at least once a week a parent could sit in class with their child they would be able to keep watch over them. As well as being able to seem more accessible to their children when a situation arises when their better judgment would be put to the test. In many cultures around the world the family dinner is a fundamental way of emphasizing the family bond. As the family gathers around the table every night for a meal a strong sense of togetherness is felt. Through these feelings children maintain respect for their parents, and with a sense of respect for ones parents comes an obligation to uphold their standards. This act alone can discourage children from engaging in behaviors they believe would disappoint their parents. Another beneficial outcome of the family dinner is the fact that most popular shows occur centered either around or during dinner. While children are at the table with family they will be away from the suggestive programming now common to the young population.</p>
