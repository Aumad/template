    <h1>Memo</h1>
    <p>The social issue of explicit music videos having a negative impact towards our society affected our composing of the project greatly. For the reason that our topic was about music videos we knew we would have to incorporate a music video in it. Composing for this issue made me better understand the types of profanity and explicit themes that were in the videos making it easier to present. We encountered many problems while organizing the documentary, some questions we often encountered were whom to interview and how to begin the video itself. The audience played a huge role in our composition. The reason we chose to include celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke was because our audience are college students with whom these artists are very popular.</p>
    <p>We selected this issue because we all agreed that this topic that was definitely an issue that must be addressed and it is also a topic that would speak to our audience. The most challenging part of the project was using another person’s cultural analysis paper because I was unfamiliar with the topic and had not done my own research on this topic previously. We did take a systematic approach to the project, we started from the beginning of the documentary and recorded as we went on rather than starting in multiple different places.</p>
    <p>The research sources that were the most beneficial were the students we interviewed here at MSU, it gave an insight on how people our age felt about the subject. The least beneficial source was the record store worker. She was much older and didn’t really pay attention to music videos and she also listened to a different genre than the other population we interviewed.</p>
    <p>Our group met many times to work on the project, we each split up the interviews so we could complete the project faster and split up tasks so everyone had something to do. Working in groups was very fruitful, it allowed me to work with people who had different literary styles than myself as well hearing inputs from other people rather than going about it alone.</p>
    <p>Our plan worked very effectively on this project and we were able to have a well done finished project before the dead line. If I was to do this project over again I would follow the same plan and structure because I am very happy with the end product.</p>
    <p>The most effective aspect of our documentary is the effectiveness, by asking real people their opinions it was easy to convey how average students felt about the profanity and explicit themes present as well as potential ways to fix the problem. We made our design decisions as a group, it began as just a mesh of each individual’s ideas and we selected the ideas that we all agreed upon.</p>
