		<h1>The Amazon Adventure</h1>
		<p>Since I was a child I had three very distinct traits about me; I had always been curious to the way things worked. I wondered how the press of a button could signal the change of a channel on the television, or how the twist of a key could start the engine of a car. Being as young as I was the world was full of questions and I was far too young to understand the answers. Another trait I had was incredible organizational skills. Everything had to have a specific place; the power rangers never mixed in the same box as my G.I. Joes. I was one of the only kids I knew that made my bed every morning, not because my parents asked me to, but simply because I could not walk away from a messy room. My other trait, which might not have been my best, but made me who I am regardless, was my insatiable impatience. My dad and I shared that trait, we were never late for anything; in fact we were often quite early for most things. Those three traits which I thought would never help me in life would actually turn out to be three very desirable traits in my major.</p>
		<p>My major is supply chain management, it involves the control of goods and how they get from one place to another. It also includes the movement and storage of raw materials. Supply chain is primarily a use of logistics. A huge aspect in the field of supply chain management is finding the most efficient way to get a product from one place to another. Supply chain has a lot to do with intrabusiness communication to make certain the correct amount of the correct item will arrive on time to the agreed upon location. The key to efficiency is effective communication from one company to another and between all the members of each company. Without effective communication, every aspect of industry would be affected and, more likely than not, fall apart. GM wouldn’t be able to build any cars unless their shipment of steel and plastic arrived on time with the correct quantity and quality for their cars. Without the raw materials needed to make products, no products would be able to be made, consumers would then have nothing to purchase, and the economy as a whole would not run the way it does. Supply chain management has such a strong role in the infrastructure of modern day business. It regulates how all the goods and supplies travel. I suppose this is what most attracted me to the field. I think I was attracted because of how involved supply chain management is in the economy. With the technological revolution of the 21st century, communication has never been easier. The grand contributor to the ease of communication, we are familiar with today, is the smart phone which grants us access to every aspect of our lives on the go.</p>
		<p>Almost all of your technological needs can be met by this device, originally built for wireless phone calls, has now developed into a wide array of uses from updating your favorite social media, to inputting symptoms into web MD, and receiving an on the spot diagnosis from your own bedroom, with no more effort than a couple key strokes. The convenience of the smart phone has not gone unnoticed, most people could not go a day without their phones by their side. We use our phones to run our businesses and even check on what is going on in the life. I received my first smart phone in 12th grade of high school and my life has never been the same since. The first thing I did after receiving my precious smart phone was to immediately download the Amazon application and order a phone case so no harm would come to my phone. That was when I had my first taste of the supply chain field. I was surprised by how I could track the location of the phone case and know exactly when it would arrive.</p>
		<p>After ordering my phone case from a company located in China, I wondered how exactly my case would get to me from such a far location. I believed that it would simply be put in a package and carried to my house by air to the local post office then hand delivered by a mail man to my door step. However, this assumption was far from correct. In the generation we live in people desire to know every aspect of a contract before they sign it. Amazon allowed you to track your package so you would know exactly where it was at all times. Out of curiosity I followed the path of my package from China, through the air into California, then shipped to a local Amazon sorting station from which it was delivered by truck to the next sorting station, and to the next until it reached my local post office and was dropped off to my house via delivery truck. The process sounds very time consuming and complicated, if I was made aware of the process before ordering I would assume it would take a week minimum for my case to reach me. However, I received my phone case a mere 3 days after placing the order. At each stop, a new barcode was placed on the box, which helped keep track of where it was. From across the world, through semi-trucks and delivery trucks and to my door step in just 3 days I was amazed. The idea astounded me of how I was able to purchase from across the globe. It would’ve took much longer if I was to fly to China myself and go to the store to purchase it, the trip there would take almost close to three days not counting the return.</p>
		<p>I wondered how this system of shipping and sorting mass quantities of different items around the country without making a mistake and delivering the wrong item to the wrong location came to fruition. I wanted to learn more, since then I have used Amazon countless times for a variety of items that were all received in a timely fashion. Only after being accepted into Michigan State and hearing of their supply chain management program that was said to be number one in the country did I realize that supply chain was exactly what I wanted to do in life.</p>
		<p>From the invention of the smart phone the whole world was accessible through my fingertips. Imagine the endless possibilities for businesses, which is exactly why I chose supply chain management as my major not to mention how highly ranked the program is at Michigan State University.. I intend to take full advantage of the incredible ease of communication we use in our everyday life, however I intend to use this amazing technology for productive purposes and for the betterment of businesses and consumers overall. I imagine a world where the rarest items could be readily available for consumers regardless of the distance separating them. We are on a fast track to this future and I plan on contributing as much as I possibly can to this ideal.</p>
