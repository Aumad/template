		<h1>Supply Chain Management</h1>
		<p>This report was written to communicate with students new to the discipline of supply chain management the importance of writing, reading, and researching in the field. Also, to build a base of understanding as to why these skills are so detrimental in being successful in this field. In order to understand why these skills are necessary I will first explain what exactly supply chain management is. Supply chain management is a field of business that is based on communication and transportation. A supply chain manager’s job is to plan the most time and cost effective method of transporting a product or materials. Research is a fundamental aspect of supply chain management. It is used in every aspect from choosing whom to do business with, how much of a product one should purchase, how to transport the product, whom to let transport the product, which method to use and route to take. Communication is another fundamental aspect of the discipline. It is used to maintain the relationship between businesses and clients. Another reason, is to make sure all shipments arrive on time, communication between transporters and businesses is a huge part of the discipline. We live in a technological era, technology is used throughout the supply chain management field. It is used to research who and how to transport a product as well as tracking products as they are moved.</p>
		<p>The discipline that I will be researching is business as a whole with the focus of Supply Chain Management. Supply Chain Management primarily concerns itself with the efficiency of product travel. When a company orders a product it must arrive to them somehow, a supply chain manager is then used to route the product in the most time and cost efficient manner. Whether it be flying a product across the globe from China to the United States or sending a package a few miles from one state to another through standard mailing services like the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
		<p>Dr. Robert Handfield, a professor at North Carolina State University wrote an article titled What is Supply Chain Management? The article summarizes what supply chain management is and the core ideas behind it. According to Dr. Handfield there are two core ideas behind supply chain management. The first is that practically every product that reaches an end user represents the cumulative effort of multiple organizations. These organizations are referred to collectively as the supply chain (Handfield, 2011). What is meant by the first idea is that no product is created by any one organization. With any final product, it must first be made by raw materials. These raw materials are either grown/harvested by another organization and the supplies are sent down the chain to the next organization onto the next until it reaches its end use. This is what is known as the supply chain. The second idea Dr. Handfield suggests is that although supply chains have existed for a long time, most organizations only focus on what happens within their own “four walls.” Few businesses understood, much less managed, the entire chain of activities that ultimately delivered products to their final customers. The result was disjointed and often ineffective supply chains (Handfield, 2011). What this second idea is meant to portray is that although there is a long standing series of chains that bring final products to a customer, most businesses are ignorant of it. They often only concern themselves with their own series in the chain, this is why supply chain managers exist. To coordinate the chain as efficiently and effectively as possible. Dr. Handfield also elaborates on this idea by defining what supply chain management is. Supply chain management, then, is the active management of supply chain activities to maximize customer value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. It represents a conscious effort by the supply chain firms to develop and run supply chains in the most effective & efficient ways possible. Supply chain activities cover everything from product development, sourcing, production, and logistics, as well as the information systems needed to coordinate these activities (Handfield, 2011). This is a broader definition, it states all the different types of activities supply chain covers. The mention of informations systems is a large part of supply chain that is often overlooked. Supply chain management is not only used in sending physical products in efficient ways, but as well as sharing information. Dr. Handfield reveals then elaborates on how physical products and information travel down the chain; the organizations that make up a supply chain are “linked” together through physical flows and information flows. Physical flows involve transformation, movement, and storage of goods and materials. They are the most visible piece of the supply chain. But just as important are information flows. Information flows allow the various supply chain partners to coordinate their long-term plans, and to control the day-to-day flow of goods and material up and down the supply chain (Handfield, 2011). By incorporating the information flows Dr. Handfield is able to show how broad supply chain management really is. The supply chain affects multiple businesses on a day-today basis as well as a year-to-year basis. Without the correct management many businesses wouldn’t be able to run as effectively. As he mentioned above, a poorly managed chain can result in disjointed and ineffective chains.</p>
		<p>Supply Chain Management plays a huge part in every type of producer/consumer business. In order to produce a product a producer would first need materials. In our free market economy it is rare that one company would produce a product completely independent of other companies for example; a paper company such as International Paper that is ran in the United States would first need raw materials from a lumber company like The Hudson River Mill. Once the River Mill has acquired the materials it is prepared to sell to International Paper, it must figure out a way to send the materials. A supply chain manager would be hired to plan a route and method of transportation for the supplies. A common method for sending supplies like logs would be to hire a trucking company to drive the supplies from the mill to International Paper the supply chain manager would be responsible for hiring the trucking company and planning the most effective route. Without the logs there would be no paper, without the supply chain manager the logs would never reach the paper company and there would be nothing to sell.</p>
		<p>Research is key to any successful business model. As listed in the paragraph above the supply chain manager must plan the most time and cost efficient method of transportation for a product. A supply chain manager for International Paper must research many elements before finalizing his plans. Some of those elements would be travel time; the Hudson River Mill is located in Corinth, New York, the International Paper company is in Memphis, Tennessee. First, the manager must research the different types of transportations available for the materials. Secondly, after choosing the transportation method successful supply chain manager would research the average travel time from these two locations and set expectations for clients accordingly. Afterwards, the manager must choose a corresponding business that would be able to transport the materials, example; if choosing two send logs through trucks you must decide which company to choose from. You must research the different companies along with their pricing, reputation, and reliability. You are held accountable for all mistakes made during the transporting process. This makes research incredibly important for this discipline. A better understanding of your segment of supply chain can lead to a much more efficient system. By researching the different suppliers and methods available you can cut costs and increase revenue. For example, International Paper could have bought logs from a different lumber company; however they found the most cost effective and reliable company which would be the Hudson River Mill.</p>
		<p>I interviewed my Macroecon professor Obst on the key role supply chain managers play in our economic system and to elaborate on different types of supply chain management systems. Professor Obst explained how communication between businesses can be very difficult especially when most businesses are in competition with each other. A supply chain manager is used to keep a business on track with their quotas and deadlines. When I asked exactly how a supply chain manager is used for this purpose he replied that supply chain managers must know exactly what a company needs, how much of it they need, and when they need it by. From there, they must strategize a plan on how to make all this possible. He continued by comparing supply chain managers to a train conductor. They always know how much cargo they are carrying, where it’s going, and when they need to be there. For this they must maintain effective communication between the different organizations his own company deals with. If a supplier doesn’t have your order ready it’s your job to make up for that in the schedule and let the next person down the chain know that you won’t be ready either.</p>
		<p>Communication is key in all aspects of life. This is especially true for a supply chain manager. When transporting products or materials you need to be in contact with supplier and consumer, the consumer will usually be another business. The reason for the intense amount of communication is for both parties to know exactly how much of what is being transported and when and where it will depart/arrive. Production is usually a time sensitive matter, quotas must be met and consumers must be kept happy. If any unexpected events occur it is important to remain in constant communication to resolve any potential problems that may occur.</p>
		<p>Along with communicating with companies within a supply chain, in order for the field to expand it is also important to communicate with other supply chain manager. This is often done through articles and publications. Such as the trade magazine known as Inside Supply Management. An article in this magazine that provides insight on successful supply chain managing titled Commercial Acumen Leads to Buyer Power states that in order to become successful in supply chain management you must understand the nuances of your industry segment so thoroughly that you can react well to any situation that occurs. This requires a strong sense of commercial acumen, an important skill for supply chain management practitioners (Goss, 2014). In summation, in any business unintended situations will arise, it is important to know your supply chain as well as possible in order to find a solution, or to have a sense of commercial acumen. The article gives a look at what commercial acumen is; commercial acumen is the ability to assess business situations and information, then make rational decisions and take sensible actions that puts your company in a more optimal position (Goss, 2014). This idea of a commercial acumen is developed through research and experience. It is important to study other systems of supply chain to develop your own effective strategy. An initial step in developing your commercial acumen is understanding the market segments in which your company purchases items and services, you can do this by reading professional journals and trade magazines specific to the categories you manage (Goss, 2014). The supply chain management field has been around for a long time, in order to become the best in this discipline you must learn from those who have been around longer than you. That is why it is important to research as many different strategies that have been implemented in different supply chain segments. The best way to do this would be to read relevant scholarly magazines and keeping up to date with the latest findings, this too will help build commercial acumen. Once you understand the market, you can further refine your commercial acumen by focusing on what you can do to help your company develop buyer power (Goss, 2014). Once you understand your field you and your company will be in a better position as buyers. Buyer power is a key in this discipline, being able to receive more volume for the same price would be an example of buyer power. Knowledge is, of course, the cornerstone of buyer power, and knowledge leads to expertise. Read as much as possible (Goss, 2014). The more one researches, the greater understanding they have of the business system. This information could be critical when problem situations occur, time is money, the more knowledge one possess, the faster they will be able to make decisions and the more efficient their system will become.</p>
		<p>I conducted an interview with a former supply chain management student who graduated from Michigan State University. Mona Simpson, who now works as a supply chain manager at Apple about the importance of the way literacies are used to create and communicate knowledge in our field. Mona gave me some insight on how it is very important to stay on pace with the latest research advancements and how knowledge itself can make the difference between a successful supply chain and a failure. She elaborated on how many companies and competitors too have their own supply chain managers. The reason being, companies are all in constant competition. The most efficient system will always prevail, it is imperative for that system to be your own. If a suppliers average delivery time for a shipment to a company such as Apple was three days, and another supplier approached apple with a shipment time of two days. Apple would go with the second company with the faster shipping time. If that first supplier managed to also bring its shipment time down to two days as well, then Apple would have no reason to change suppliers. That is why it is important to constantly be learning, as technology changes and our society moves at a faster pace we too must change our systems and adapt to maintain as much efficiency as possible. Mona went on to explain that she herself is subscribed to many different newsletters and trade magazines to stay up to date with the latest findings. She explained how she also travels to supply chain conferences to learn as much as she can so she may also move up her job chain and hopefully manage her own system.</p>
		<p>Technology is used in many aspects of the discipline. It is used in the research process, transporting, and communicating processes. For researching the use of computers and data bases are very useful. During transportation it is technology such as trains and trucks that carry the product. In addition, technology is used to track products whether it be via satellite tracking or scanning of bar codes listing a products last location for periodical schedule updates. This is very useful when communicating between businesses as to where a product is and when it will arrive. Phones, computers, bar code systems, and satellite tracking are all methods used to communicate with businesses. Technology is a vital part of any good supply chain system, it is important to hold power over technology rather than relying on suppliers’ technology. In this way it would be easier to switch to a new supplier. That is why it is important to stay up to date with the latest technological innovations in the field. A good way to stay up to date would be reading the latest research publications and trade magazines as well as your own independent research.</p>
		<p>To those new to the discipline of supply chain management a tremendous amount of importance is placed upon literacies in the field. It is used to communicate the latest information as well as being used to develop effective strategies in the field itself. The more knowledge a supply chain manager possess the more efficient his chain can become. That is why it is important to constantly be researching and staying on pace with the developing world around us. The greater commercial acumen a person can develop, the more power they will possess as a supply chain manager. The only way to develop a strong sense of acumen is by learning either through experience or research.</p>
